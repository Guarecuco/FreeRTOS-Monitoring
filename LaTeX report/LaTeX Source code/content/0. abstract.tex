More specifically this report will discuss the basic components of IoT clusters in order to map the attack surface of such applications. The research will then be used to find potential ways to implement a keylogger monitoring internal parameters of a device running the FreeRTOS operating system. The report includes description of possible real life application and how monitoring solutions can be applied to them. A demo solution will be implemented and analyzed. \\
